# WastepackCalculator
A calculator to calculalte how many wastepack atomisers you need

The first coloumn for the amount of 1 bandwidth mechanoids you own, the second coloumn for 2 bandwith mechanoids and so on.

Press Calculate and the number in the bottom right indicates the amount of wastepack atomisers needed to fully sustain your mechanoids.
Note, that the program automatically rounds up, so if you technically need 5.16 atomisers, the program will tell you, you need 6.
